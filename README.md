# BayesianInference
Applications of Bayesian Inference to hospital data

# Summary
This projects implements Bayesian Inference to frame probabilities not so much in terms of "how many times would I expect this event to occur if the experiment were to be rerun many times" but rather in terms of "what is my belief in the likelihood of this event occurring?" In a Bayesian probabilistic programming context, we can build models for systems and then let the data tell us how likely certain values for our model parameters are. This can be a very useful way to incorporate prior knowledge and deal with limited data.
